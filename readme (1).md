# Transport Carbon Footprint Calculator

An interactive web application built with Streamlit that helps users calculate and visualize their monthly carbon footprint based on their daily commute and transportation choices.

## Features

- Calculate carbon emissions based on detailed vehicle specifications
- Support for various transportation modes:
  - Two-wheelers (Scooters, Motorcycles)
  - Three-wheelers
  - Four-wheelers (various car types)
  - Public transport (Taxi, Bus, Metro)
- Compare your emissions with alternative transport options
- Receive personalized sustainability recommendations
- Interactive visualizations and metrics

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transport-carbon-calculator.git
   cd transport-carbon-calculator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```
   streamlit run temp.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Fill in your commute details:
   - Daily one-way distance
   - Commuting days per week
   - Commuting weeks per month
   - Type of transport (private/public/both)
   - Vehicle specifications

4. Click "Calculate Carbon Footprint" to see your results

## Calculation Methodology

The application uses emission factors for different vehicle types, sizes, and fuel types to calculate carbon footprint. These factors are based on typical COâ‚‚ equivalent emissions per kilometer. Key factors that influence emissions include:

- Vehicle type (two-wheeler, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, public transport)
- Fuel type (petrol, diesel, CNG, electric)
- Engine size (cc)
- Ridesharing (number of people sharing the vehicle)
- For combined transport modes, the ratio of private to public transport usage
